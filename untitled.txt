- Ignore overlap
- 1 experiment with no contact tracing
- Removing nodes - uptake (10-100%)
- tau_vals = np.array([0, .03, .05, .1, .2, .5]) -> random tracing, contact tracing rates
- pa .2 .5

- k = 10, 20 average-degree
- netsize 1000, 10000

- relative-infectiousness 0.5 ?! KEEP
- relative-random-tracing .8 ?! -> Is / Ia

- noncompliance rate -> .002 ?! * time_since_tracing
- second network?! (manual tracing)
